# 👋🏽 Nokio Twumasi  
AI-Focused Software Engineer • LLM Systems • Full-Stack Engineering

I design and build production-grade AI systems that integrate large-language-model reasoning, retrieval architectures, and modern full-stack engineering. My work spans end-to-end application development, cloud infrastructure, and LLM orchestration using tools like LangChain, LangGraph, LangSmith, and Hugging Face Transformers.

## 🚀 About Me
I specialize in building applied AI software: platforms that combine real user workflows with robust model reasoning, vector retrieval, and scalable backend systems. I’m particularly focused on real-world use cases where LLMs act as agents, evaluators, or domain-specific reasoning engines.

Over the past year, I’ve shipped AI-powered products using Next.js, TypeScript, Python, Supabase, Postgres, OpenAI, embeddings, AWS, and modern orchestration frameworks. I enjoy experimenting with multi-step reasoning pipelines, custom tools for agents, and retrieval systems that blend structured and unstructured data.

## 🧠 AI Focus Areas
- Large-language-model orchestration (LangChain, LangGraph, LangSmith)  
- Vector database architectures with Postgres/pgvector and Supabase  
- Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with advanced chunking and custom embeddings  
- LLM agents with tool calling, state machines, and multi-node workflows  
- Hugging Face Transformers, sentence transformers, and model fine-tuning experiments  
- AI evaluation frameworks, prompt optimization, and observability for model behavior  
- End-to-end AI product engineering with Next.js + TypeScript + Python  

## 🔍 Featured Projects
### interviews.study
An AI interview-prep platform built with Next.js, TypeScript, Supabase, OpenAI, embeddings, and LangChain.
Features include:  
- RAG over role-specific interview knowledge  
- Question generation using embeddings + semantic search  
- Session memory for multi-turn interview simulations  
- Real-time agent evaluation of responses  
- Clean, production-ready Next.js architecture

### Election Verification System
A full pipeline that ingests scanned documents, extracts structured data using AWS Textract, and validates results against manual user input.
Includes:  
- Image extraction + OCR pipelines  
- Validation logic for mismatches  
- AI-powered auditing flows  
- PostgreSQL + S3 + secure role-based access

### AI Orchestration Experiments
A personal playground exploring:
